# ts-essentials-functions

This is a collection of functions that I use in my projects. I'm sharing them here in case they are useful to anyone else.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add ts-essentials-functions
```

## Usage

Documentation is in progress. For now, you can look at the source code to see what each function does....
